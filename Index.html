    <P>Hey, I'm Nicholas Rich and welcome to my static space. I love reading, thinking about random stuff and dabbling 
    with diverse subjects. I will be taking mental dumps in my "blog" section and will be listing the books I have read in the "bookshelf"
    session.</P>

    <p>The lockdown period has been an inflection point in my life. I was once plagued with existential crisis but have discovered
      three factors that has breathed meaning to life. Firstly, the importance of knowledge acquisition. Secondly, developing
    a multidisciplinary mind and lastly, having a child-like curiosity. The 3rd factor kinda covers the first 2 :p hahah</p>

    <P>I have been spending the past few months reading more extensively and intensively than ever before and I hope you will be inspired 
    to do the same and make it a moral obligation to compound your knowledge daily.</P>

    <P> I have used wordpress and blogspot in the past to digitally pen down my ideas. However, coding a website
      has definitely been pretty damn fun.(Coders please don't mock my newbie skills :( )
      Anyways, hope you find some utility here.
    </P>

  
    <p> Before I sign off, here's an appetising quote from <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>.</p>

    <P> <Strong>Spend each day trying to be a 
      little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, 
      you will get out of life what you deserve. </Strong></P>
    <P>Lots of love,</P>
    <P> Nicholas Rich</P>
