  <h1>About</h1>
  <ul>
    <P>Hi and welcome to Nicholas Rich's white space (almost literally). I love reading, thinking about random stuff and dabbling 
    with diverse subjects. I will be taking mental dumps in my "blog" section and will be listing the books I have read in the "bookshelf"
    session.</P>

    <p>Covid 19 has been a remarkable turning point in my life. I realised the importance of knowledge acquisition, developing
    a multidisciplinary approach towards life and having a child like curiosity. The 3rd factor kinda covers the first 2 :p hahah</p>

    <P>I have been spending the past few months reading more extensively and intensively than ever before and I hope you will be inspired 
    to do the same and make it a moral obligation to become a more knowledgeable person.</P>

    <p>In case you're wondering why I chose to code my website instead of using wordpress.... if you can't be bothered, skip to "peace and love"

    </p>

    <P> I was inspired by Patrick Collison. I saw how simple his website was and so I decided to create one myself. I've always been 
      averse to software stufff..but I figured I'd step out of my ancient comfort zone for once and do this. Moving right alongg..
    </P>
    <P>Peace and Love,</P>
    <P> Nicholas Rich</P>
